# Snake
Snake in C, nothing too excentric. Could have done a much better job imo but yeah.

Used this for a nice look into making a good game loop: https://dewitters.com/dewitters-gameloop/. Didn't need to use anything complicated since we wanted to lock game logic and rendering to the same frame.

71% of time during game loop is spent calling ``` system("cls") ```, would love to use ANSI escape characters however I created this using windows.
